> 21. The `alt` attribute provides an alternate text description for the image that is displayed when the image cannot be displayed or when a user is using a screen reader to access the content. It improves the accessibility of the web page, helps search engines understand the content of the image, and can act as a placeholder while the image is loading.

> 22. The primary purpose of both tags is to convey semantic meaning, rather than to change the visual appearance of the text, although by default the text within <strong> tags is displayed in bold and the text within <em> tags is displayed in italics
>
> 23. The `<meta>` tag is used to provide metadata for an HTML document, and is placed within the `<head>` section of the document. It provides information about the page that is not displayed directly in the browser, and is used for a variety of purposes, such as specifying the character encoding, providing a description and keywords for the page, setting the viewport for mobile devices, and more. By providing additional information about the content, using the `<meta>` tag can help improve the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and usability of a web page.
>
> 24. The `<br>` tag in HTML is a line break tag, used to create a line break within a block of text. Unlike other tags that create a new block element or change the appearance of text, the `<br>` tag simply adds a single line break, without any extra spacing or indentation. This can be useful when you want to create a line break within a paragraph, or when you want to create a list of items that appear on separate lines. The `<br>` tag is an empty tag, which means it does not require a closing tag. The use of the `<br>` tag should be limited, as it is generally better to structure content using proper HTML elements and CSS styling to create whitespace and line breaks.
>
> 25. The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form that allows users to input data and send it to a server for processing. Forms can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gathering user feedback, accepting orders or registrations, or conducting surveys. When a user submits a form, the data is typically sent to a server-side script that processes the input and responds accordingly. The `<form>` tag can include a number of different input elements, such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select menus, which allow users to input different types of data. The `action` attribute of the `<form>` tag specifies the URL of the script or program that will handle the form data, and the `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) that will be used to send the data. The `<form>` tag can also be styled using CSS to customize its appearance and layout.
>
> 26. The `<ol>` and `<ul>` tags in HTML are used to create ordered and unordered lists, respectively. The primary difference between the two is the way they display the list items. The `<ol>` tag creates a numbered list, where each item is preceded by a sequential number. The numbering can be customized using the `start` and `type` attributes, and different types of numbering can be used, such as Roman numerals or letters. On the other hand, the `<ul>` tag creates a bulleted list, where each item is preceded by a bullet point or other symbol. The symbol can be customized using CSS, and different types of symbols can be used, such as circles, squares, or icons. Both tags can include any type of content within each list item, such as text, images, or other HTML elements. Lists can be nested within each other, allowing for the creation of complex hierarchies of information.
>
> 27. The `<a>` tag in HTML is used to create a hyperlink, which allows users to navigate between different web pages or sections of a web page. The `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag specifies the URL of the destination page or location within the current page. When a user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser navigates to the specified URL or location. The `<a>` tag can also include additional attributes, such as `target` to specify the window or frame in which the destination page should be loaded, or `title` to provide additional information about the link. The `<a>` tag can also be used to create email links or links to other types of resources, such as documents or media files. By using hyperlinks, web designers can create a seamless and interconnected web experience for users, allowing them to easily access information and navigate between different pages and sites.
>
> 28. The `<title>` tag and the `<h1>` tag serve different purposes in HTML. The `<title>` tag is used to specify the title of a web page, which appears in the browser's title bar and in search engine results. It is an important element for SEO and provides a brief summary of the page's content. On the other hand, the `<h1>` tag is used to define the main heading of a web page and typically appears at the top of the page. It is used to indicate the main topic or purpose of the page, and to give the user a clear idea of what they can expect to find on the page. While both tags are used to provide information about the content of the page, they have different functions and should be used appropriately.
>
> 29. The `<table>` tag in HTML is used to create structured data in a tabular form. It is a container element that holds one or more rows, which in turn hold one or more cells, or data items. Tables are commonly used to present data in an organized way, such as in a chart or schedule. The `<table>` tag allows the content to be divided into rows and columns, with each cell able to contain different types of content, such as text, images, or links. Tables can also be used to create layouts, although this practice is discouraged in modern web design. To create a table, you must use a combination of table-related elements, including `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` or `<th>` tags. Proper use of these elements can help create accessible and semantically meaningful tables.
>
> 30. The `<label>` tag in HTML is used to associate a label with a form element. This helps improve the usability and accessibility of a form, as it provides a clear and concise description of what the form element is for. When a user clicks on a label, it automatically sets focus on the form element associated with it, making it easier to fill out the form. The `<label>` tag can also improve accessibility for users with disabilities, such as those using screen readers, as it provides additional context about the form element. By using the `<label>` tag, web developers can create more user-friendly forms that are easier to navigate and understand. Additionally, by properly associating form elements with their respective labels, developers can improve the accessibility and usability of their web pages for all users.
